I have two scripts which I would like to share. 
The first one adds a dummy atom (or more) to existing trajectory (dcd). 
The second one calculates orientational order parameters p1, p2 and p21 and tetrahedral order parameter Q for the first hydration shell.  For more details see:

I also uploaded pdb and psf files of the system (C60 with dummy atom at the center in SPCE water box).
