I have three scripts which I would like to share. 
The first one adds a dummy atom (or more) to existing trajectory (dcd). 
The second one calculates orientational order parameters p1, p2 and p21 and tetrahedral order parameter Q for the first hydration shell. 
The third one calculates the polarization of water in hydration shell of different diameters. The result polarization from this code can be used to calculate the dielectric constant of water at the interface of the solute. 

For more details see:

I also uploaded pdb and psf files of the system (C60 with dummy atom at the center in SPCE water box).
